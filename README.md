## A small summary of  how/why I started writing the README.md file:

As a beginner, I was not aware of the advantages of a README file. So as I'm in a learning stage I used to share most of my work with my seniors or the person who is already in this domain.

And while sharing my work with them I understood one thing that people are always interested in short and simple things which can be easy to understand. They don't want to spend more time in a single place.

While thinking about the above concern this came to my mind! Hey, why not do something which can save time as well as help others to understand your repository easily then I came across this README.md file thing which provides me the flexibility to present my work in a simple way.
