### A small summary of  how I started writing the README.md file:

As a beginner, I was not aware of the advantages of a README file. So as I'm in a learning stage I used to share most of my work with my seniors or the person already in this domain.

And while sharing my work with them, I understood that people are always interested in short and simple things that can be easy to understand. They don't want to spend more time in a single place.

While thinking about the above concern this came to my mind! Hey, why not do something which can save time and help others to understand your repository easily then I came across this README.md file thing which provides me the flexibility to present my work in a simple way.



# Summary of Python Repository:

#### 1. 01_Array.ipynb:
       
Although python doesn't have concept of an array. it does have some in-build data structures which provide similar functionality as an array.
instead of an array python has a list, tuple, set, and dictionary.
