### A small summary of  how I started writing the README.md file:

As a beginner, I was not aware of the advantages of a README file. So as I'm in a learning stage I used to share most of my work with my seniors or the person already in this domain.

And while sharing my work with them, I understood that people are always interested in short and simple things that can be easy to understand. They don't want to spend more time in a single place.

While thinking about the above concern this came to my mind! Hey, why not do something which can save time and help others to understand your repository easily then I came across this README.md file thing which provides me the flexibility to present my work in a simple way.



# Summary of Python Repository:

### 1. 01_Array.ipynb:
       
Although Python doesn't have the concept of an array. However, it does have some in-build data structures which provide similar functionality as an array.
instead of an array python has a list, tuple, set, and dictionary. These data structures are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

In this 01_Array.ipynb file I have solved problems that are relevant to list, tuple, set, and dictionary. 

#### List: 
A list is a type of data structure that is ordered and mutable! We can access its elements by index and we can remove and add elements to a list. the list is represented by square brackets [ ] and it allows duplicate values which can be any type of data.

While solving problems that are relevant to the list I have used some important methods of the list. Like insert(), append(), del(), pop(),remove(),sort(), and list comprehension along with loops.
