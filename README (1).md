## A small summary of  how I started writing the README.md file:

As a beginner, I was not aware of the advantages of a README file. So as I'm in a learning stage I used to share most of my work with my seniors or the person who is already in this domain.

And while sharing my work with them I understood one thing that people are always interested in short and simple things which can be easy to understand. They don't want to spend more time in a single place.

Then I understood the importance of a README file. To save time for others, I can write a small summary of my work with the help of a README file, which will help others to understand easily.
